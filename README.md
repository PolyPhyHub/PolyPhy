# PolyPhy
*PolyPhy* is an unconventional toolkit for reconstructing continuous networks out of sparse 2D or 3D data. Such data can be defined as collections of discrete points, or a continuous sparse scalar field. *PolyPhy* produces a scalar density field that defines the recovered network structure. With the help of GPU-accelerated simulation and visualization, *PolyPhy* provides domain experts an interactive way to reconstruct discrete geometric data with an underlying network structure. The reconstruction is driven by the *Monte Carlo Physarum Machine* algorithm, a metaheuristic inspired by the morphology and dynamics of Physarum polycephalum aka 'slime mold'.

## Related Resources
- *PolyPhy* is a successor of [Polyphorm](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/Polyphorm)
- Main GitHub page: [PolyPhy Hub](https://github.com/PolyPhyHub)
- Official website: [polyphy.io](https://polyphy.io)
- Underlying research: [overview](https://elek.pub/projects/Rhizome-Cosmology/) and [publications](https://elek.pub/research.html)

## System Requirements
- Decent GPU, currently tested NVIDIA GPUs, other brands subject to support by the [Taichi API](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi)
  - CPU fallback available for debugging purposes
- Recent Windows, Linux or Mac OS
- Python 3.x, Anaconda recommended

## Repository
The repository is located at the following GitHub URL:<br/>
<https://github.com/PolyPhyHub/PolyPhy.git>

## Functionality
The use-cases currently supported by *PolyPhy* are divided according to the data workflow they are built around. Each use-case has a corresponding Jupyter notebook that implements it located in **./experiments/Jupyter**. This section reviews them case by case, and the following section provides an extensive tutorial recorded at the recent OSPO Symposium 2022.

- **2D self-patterning** is the most basic use-case implemented within the **./experiments/Jupyter/PolyPhy_2D_discrete_data** notebook. The ability of MCPM to generate a diversity of patterns with network characteristics is achieved by disabling the data marker deposition, leaving only the MCPM agents to generate the marker responsible for maintaining structure.<p>

</p>

- **2D procedural pipeline** provide an easy environment to experiment with the behavior of *PolyPhy* in the presence of discrete data with different spatial frequencies. Editing (adding new data points) is also supported. This pipeline is implemented in the **./experiments/Jupyter/PolyPhy_2D_discrete_data** notebook.<p>

</p>

- **2D discrete pipeline** implements the canonical way of working with custom data defined by a CSV file. The example below demonstrates fitting to a 2D projection of the SDSS galaxy dataset. This pipeline is implemented in the **./experiments/Jupyter/PolyPhy_2D_discrete_data** notebook.<p>

</p>

- **2D continuous pipeline** demonstrates the workflow with a continuous user-provided dataset. Instead of a discrete set of points as in the previous use-cases, the data is defined by a scalar field, which in 2D amounts to a grayscale image. The example below approximates the US road network using only a sparse population density map as the input. This pipeline is implemented in the **./experiments/Jupyter/PolyPhy_2D_continuous_data** notebook.<p>

</p>

- **3D discrete pipeline** represents an equivalent functionality to the original *Polyphorm* implementation. The dataset consists of SDSS galaxies defined as a weighted collection of 3D points. THe visualization is based on volumetric ray marching simultaneously fetching the deposit and the trace fields. This pipeline is implemented in the **./experiments/Jupyter/PolyPhy_3D_discrete_data** notebook.<p>

## How to Use PolyPhy
Below is a recording of the [PolyPhy Workshop](https://elek.pub/workshop_cross2022.html) given as part of the [OSPO Symposium 2022](https://ospo.ucsc.edu/event/20220927/).<br/>
This 93-minute workshop covers *PolyPhy*'s research background, all of the 5 above usecases, and extended technical discussion.
